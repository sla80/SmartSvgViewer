# Changelog

### Update 0.5.0.1520 (2024-01-14)

A very long awaited update :)
- Changed the license from MIT to MS-PL in order to be able to release the source code soon. Don't worry, it's still free for personal and commercial use.
- Updated all libraries. Now heavier SVG images are opened successfully, and complex SVG images are drawn much more accurately.
- Improved support for defective SVG files. Now they are displayed in the gallery, but instead of a preview they have the parsing error text.
- The application now works in 64-bit mode on 64-bit Windows.
- Shortcuts in the menu now work (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+F, etc).
- Other minor fixes and improvements.
